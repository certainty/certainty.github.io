Hi There!

I am David Krentzlin located in Germany and I am passionate about computer science.

Having learned Lisp/Scheme very early on in my career I went on to study among other things Ruby, Prolog, Haskell
and lately Elixir.

Besides programming languages I am interested in a plethora of topics including:

* distributed systems
* concurrency
* cryptography
* type systems

I currently work as a software engineer at Xing, where I get to use Ruby and Elixir to tackle
the complexities of today's software systems.

I wish you all a great time and I hope you enjoy reading. Cheers!
