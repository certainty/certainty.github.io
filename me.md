Hi!

I'm David Krentzlin, a programming language geek, somewhat obsessed with typed functional programming, a self-driven learner, a growing teacher and interested in a whole plethora of technical topics like:

* GraphQL
* type systems
* distributed systems
* concurrency
* cryptography

Besides that I have curious interest in how people work, how we think, feel and ultimately come to terms with our
unique set of skills and shortcomings. I try to understand how we can sustain in this industry, keep learning, face successes and failures, and bring forth the best in us without losing ourselves, our humanity or our private lives.

Currently I work as a software engineer on the IPA team at XING SE.
We are building and maintaining API infrastructure, most notably a GraphQL-to-REST gateway. 
Here I get to work with some of the sharpest, nicest and most inspiring people I have met sofar.

You can find more information about my professional experience in my **[resume]({{ site.url }}/career/resume.pdf)**.

Cheers,
David
