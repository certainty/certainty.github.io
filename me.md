Hi!

I'm David Krentzlin and I have a curious interest in how people work, think, feel and ultimately come to terms with their unique set of skills and shortcomings. I try to understand how we can sustain in this industry, keep learning, face successes and failures and bring forth the best in us without losing ourselves, our humanity or private lives.

Nowadays I am leading a team of brilliant and talented software engineers and architects at [NEW WORK SE][1].
We are building and operating our GraphQL-API infrastructure which is an equally challenging, exciting and demanding task. 

The technical me is a programming language geek, somewhat obsessed with typed functional programming, a self-driven learner, a growing teacher and interested in a whole plethora of technical topics like: 
* GraphQL
* type systems
* distributed systems
* concurrency
* cryptography
